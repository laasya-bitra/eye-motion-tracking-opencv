# eye-motion-tracking-opencv

This project is about tracking the eye ball movement using haar cascade classifier.This classification algorithm is the best one to choose for detection applications.Haar cascade uses sliding window approach to track the image/video data.Considering the online proctoring exam application,in this file I added the alert message to pop up on the screen.So that the person who is taking exam should be present on the screen.
